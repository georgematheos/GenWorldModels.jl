TODOs

I think we may want a different parameter for the starts and ends of sounds.
I have currently hacked this in at line 57 of detector.jl; remove this hard-coded thing.

I also made some changes to `smart_birth_death.jl` in the score function, playing around with
when we use the error_gram vs observed_gram.  It may be worth thinking about this a bit more.

The example open in the Jupyter notebook is still causing problems...in this example, I think that
birth/death should be able to produce the noise in the scene, but it is not being detected somehow.
